     <h1><strong>Gryffindor</strong></h1>
     <p id="p1">
        
        <br>Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by <em>Godric Gryffindor</em>. 
        Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics 
        he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal 
        was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as 
        "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House ghost.
        Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colors scarlet and gold 
        were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing 
        the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.</br>

        <br>The entrance to the Gryffindor common room (which, in turn, lead to the Gryffindor dormitories) is located behind a large painting of a Fat Lady in a pink 
        silk dress. If you know the right password to tell her, she swings open to reveal a round opening in the wall. The common room contains a lot of squashy 
        armchairs, a fireplace, and tables. The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network, but as it is extremely public except in the dead of night, 
        Gryffindors usually use owls to communicate with their families instead. There's also a notice board, for public announcements such as the date of the next 
        Hogsmeade weekend, but also for notices from individual students seeking to buy or sell secondhand books, or trade Chocolate Frog cards, or similar, as in 
        any school. </br>

        <br>There are two staircases opening off the common room into the Tower itself: the boys' staircase, on which the seven boys' dormitories are located 
        (one for each year) and the girls' staircase, on which the seven girls' dormitories are located (one for each year). 
        The girls' staircase is under a spell so that if a boy sets foot on it and persists for a few steps, a wailing klaxon goes off and the staircase 
        temporarily Transfigures itself into a stone slide, sending him and anyone else on the stairs sailing to the bottom. 
        According to Hogwarts: A History, the founders believed that girls were more trustworthy than boys, so that while the girls' staircase is enchanted to
         prevent boys from getting in, the boys' staircase does not carry a reciprocal enchantment (OP17). Each dormitory is a round room with windows looking out 
         onto the grounds, and containing four-poster beds.</br>

    <h1><strong>Slytherin</strong></h1>
     <p id="p2">
         <br>Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by <em>Salazar Slytherin</em>. 
         In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics 
         he most valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. The founder highly valued and 
         favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status
          could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
         Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs
         in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.</br>
         
         <br>The Slytherin common room is a low-ceilinged, dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs, with skulls all around. It is located under the lake,
          and has tapestries decorated with scenes from the lives of famous Slytherins. According to the Slytherin House Introduction Letter, 
          the beds in the dormitories are four-posters with green silk hangings and covers embroidered with silver threads. You can hear the soothing sound of the 
          lake lapping against the windows at night.</br>

 <div>
    <h1><strong>Ravenclaw</strong></h1>
     <p id="p3">
        
       <br>Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
        Its founder was the medieval witch <em>Rowena Ravenclaw</em>. Members of this house were characterized by their 
        wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colors. 
        The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw,
        daughter of Rowena. Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House 
        colors were chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.
        The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.</br>
     
        <br>Ravenclaw Tower, which is located on the west side of the castle; the entrance is a door at the top of a tightly winding spiral staircase that 
        leads up from the fifth floor. The door has neither handle nor keyhole, but a talking bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Rather than asking for a 
        conventional password, the knocker will ask a question; if answered correctly, the knocker will compliment the person on the answer and the door will swing
         open.<br>

        <br>The common room, like the other House common rooms, is decorated in House colors blue and bronze silk wall hangings, in this case, and a midnight-blue
         carpet decorated with stars. The room is wide, circular, and very airy, with a domed ceiling painted with stars, and walls with graceful arched windows 
         that provide a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. There are bookcases, tables, and chairs, and opposite the entrance is another door leading 
         to the dormitories. Beside this door is a plinth on which stands a life-size statue in white marble of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her diadem.</br>

    <h1><strong>Hufflepuff</strong></h1>
    <p id="p4">

        <br>Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        Its founder was the medieval witch <em>Helga Hufflepuff</em>. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, 
        valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic 
        animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colors. The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the 
        Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost. Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that 
        reason that the House colors were chosen: 
        yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. 
        The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated 
        exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</br>
        
        <br>The Hufflepuff Common Room is accessed through a pile of barrels that is in a recess a little past the still life painting that is the entrance to the 
        kitchens; to reach it, you enter a door to the right of the main staircase in the Entrance Hall and down a staircase there. Although it is 
        therefore at dungeon level, it is “as dissimilar as possible” from the Potions classroom. The common room is decorated in House colors, which in this 
        case means that there are lots of yellow hangings; like Gryffindor Tower, it has a lot of comfortable armchairs. There are “little underground tunnels 
        leading to the dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops” (BLC, JKR).One gains entry to the Hufflepuff common room by tapping 
        out the rhythm to the name “Helga Hufflepuff” on a stack of barrels. Tapping incorrectly or on the wrong barrel will cause one of the barrels to spill 
        vinegar all over the person trying to enter</br>
